#### Install Keras

It's easiest to install `keras` by carefully following the directions from https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/keras-instructions.html, which is the ISLR2 book website. These instructions were working recently for Windows, Mac and Linux. Installation should be relatively painless and not disruptive to your current setup (e.g. projects relying on Python or Tensorflow) but check the preamble in the instructions if you are concerned. The installation will set up an instance of Miniconda that will isolate Python and Tensorflow from other versions on your computer. On Windows 10, the default installation is into /Users/<username>/Documents/islr-miniconda and a new start menu item is added called Miniforge3.
