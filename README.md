Machine learning for ecology in a nutshell

These are slides and code for an overview of machine learning in ecology for a talk I gave to the R Club in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at University of Colorado Boulder. It is a condensed summary of a graduate course I taught for spring semester 2022. I briefly describe some key model algorithms. Click on the `.md` files for nicely formatted viewing on GitHub right here or work through the `.R` files in R on your computer.

For a deeper dive into these algorithms and more, including video lectures, head over to the **Machine Learning for Ecology** course's GitHub organization:
